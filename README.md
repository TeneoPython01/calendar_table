<h3>
PURPOSE:
</h3>
Quickly and easily generate a calendar
table with many columns of date dimensions
and metadata. Output to dataframe or CSV
to ingest into a database or for use in
an application like Excel or PowerBI.

<h3>
WHAT KIND OF COLUMNS?
</h3>
First of all, you'll find the usual dimensions:
<ul>
  <li> year number, month number, day number, yearmonth, yearquarter
  <li> month name, day name, full date w ordinal suffix (e.g., "January 3rd, 2012")
  <li> etc.
</ul>
    
Additionally, some interesting and unique data elements include:
<ul>
<li> holiday identification including Easter in any year (including pre-1583)
<li> moon phase identification
<li> sunrise/sunset for UTC as well as user-provided lat/lon coordinates
<li> length of daylight / darkness each day/evening
</ul>

For more information about the date dimensions and fields available, see these supporting documents:
<ul>
<li> Documentation: <a href="./docs/col_descriptions.html">Full column list with datatypes and descriptions</a> (download and then open with a browser)
<li> Documentation: <a href="./temp_csv.csv">Sample output</a>
</ul>


<h3>
WHY CREATE A CALENDAR TABLE / DATE DIMENSION TABLE?
</h3>
Calendar tables have myriad uses.  Examples:
<ul>
<li> PROCESS FLOW CONTROLS<br>
  Check today's date.  If it is a Sunday or the
  last day of the month, then run a code block.
<li> SLICING DATA FOR ANALYSIS<br>
  From the revenue dataset, show me all sales that
  fall between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and
  determine which days be best for best door-
  buster promotions
<li> FEATURES FOR MACHINE LEARNING MODELS<br>
  Using a polynomial linear regression, predict
  the end-of-month sales using the month-to-date
  sales along with the knowledge of what percent
  through the month the data is, comparing
  to similar data from prior months.
<li> DATA VISUALIZATION<br>
  In Microsoft PowerBI, or in Excel, or in Tableau,
  or in any tool... Use the workday of the month as
  the x-axis in a bar chart that shows the change
  in time clocked by employees on a given project
  in a given month
<li> AND MORE?<br>
  Send me more examples to add!
</ul>

<h3>
INSTALLATION/SETUP:
</h3>
Clone, checkout, or download the .py and run it in Python 3.7+.
No special imports will be needed outside of standard
libraries.

<h3>
NOTES:
</h3>
<ul>
<li> Example CSV output is provided in git repo
<li> When this code is run for a span of 5 years:
<ul>
<li> ~2,200 rows of data are created with ~100 columns (~220k cells)
<li> the resulting CSV's filesize is about 1.4 MiB
<li> the script takes 25 seconds on my raspberry pi 4B (very low specs)
<li> code will run much faster on a modern laptop or desktop
</ul>
<li> No special import statements needed besides standard Python
  3.7+ packages
<li> 32-bit OS and hardware may cause limitations in the ability
  to generate table data for years far in the future (2040)
  and throw "OverflowError: timestamp out of range for
  platform time_t"; no limitation has been observed on
  64-bit systems.  
</ul>

<h3>
TO DO:
</h3>
<ul>
<li> modularize codes with classes/functions
<li> use config file to set main params (start,
  end, holiday rules, lat/lon for localized
  data like moon phase, sunrise, etc.)
<li> add columns
<ul>
<li> percent through w / ym / y / etc
<li> add season based on official start/end of seasons? (equinox, etc)
</ul>
<li> fix bugs in the following:
<ul>
<li> night duration utc / night duration local
</ul>
</ul>
