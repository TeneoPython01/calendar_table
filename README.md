# calendar_table
The last calendar table you'll ever need!  Great for process flow conditions (e.g., check to see if today is the first Sunday in the year before running a code block), slicing data (e.g., compare data from workday x each month), features for machine learning models (e.g., use "percent of month complete" as a feature in a regression), data visualization (e.g., use calendar metadata as filter or axis in a PowerBI view), and more!
